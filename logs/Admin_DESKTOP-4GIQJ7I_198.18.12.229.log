Unlike scalping, day trading requires keeping the positions open for longer intervals, typically lasting a few hours before pausing all activities by the end of the trading day.

Day trading is one of the best Forex trading techniques as investors can smoothly integrate it into their working day, starting as the trading day commences and closing the last position by session-end.

Day traders may find two or three suitable opportunities in different Forex markets and assets and take their time before closing them, whether simultaneously or one at a time. Forex day trading strategy requires careful technical and fundamental analysis to find a position that can bring profits.
